# N-Body-Problem

This is a particular python implementation of the N-Body Problem that I'm doing as part of my python learning process. I work as a netadmin, and lately I've started learning about coding and devnet topics in general, and about Python in particular. During the COVID-19 quarantine and lockdown in Spain, I decided to start a python project to practice what I was learning. Being a space exploration and sci-fy fan, I got inspiration from the Star Trek: Picard TV show, where a fictitious stable octanary star system is described. Creating a n-body problem simulation with python seemed like a good idea to try to find such a stable configuration, and see how it could look like.
